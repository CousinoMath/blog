# A Better Reading of Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems

In this post, I’d like to present an alternative reading to Gödel’s
Incompleteness Theorems from the more popular version. I will give casual
statements of the two theorems in the next section. But I want quickly
state that I am not refuting these seminal theorems. Rather my goal is
offer an alternative interpretation for what they say about the pursuit
of mathematical knowledge.

## Brief Explanation of [Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems][1]

In 1931, Kurt Gödel published the first incompleteness theorem which rocked
logic and mathematics. It essentially said that there are statements within
arithmetic which are true but cannot be proven within arithmetic. But this does
not simply apply to only arithmetic. Any area of mathematics which is capable
of doing arithmetic must have true statements which are not provable. This is
the reason for the “incompleteness” in the name. Imagine that you are working
in one area of math and you one of these Gödel statements, true but not
provable. Frustrated that you cannot prove everything which is true, your only
option is to change the area of mathematics in which you work by either adding
to your current one or moving to a separate area. Yet Gödel’s theorem thwarts
you there too. Even if your newly chosen type of math can give a proof of your
original statement, Gödel shows that there another statement in this new math
which is true and unprovable.
