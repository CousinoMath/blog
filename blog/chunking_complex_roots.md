# Observation about Chunking Math #

This is a simple post observing patterns in student&rsquo;s work on questions
like the following.

> Write out a polynomial, in factored form, with real coefficients, which has
> the following zeros: `\(-5\)` with multiplicity `\(2\)`, `\(4\)` with
> multiplicity `\(3\)`, `\(1 + 2 i\)` with multiplicity `\(1\)`.

The following is my assumption about typical student reasoning, and does not
reflect any knowledge or evidence that students actually think this way.

## A Common Incorrect Answer ##

A common answer that I see, and have come to expect, from students is
`\((x + 5)^{2} (x - 4)^{3} (1 + 2 i) (1 - 2 i)\)`. They fail to correctly write
the factors associated with the complex roots. I've gleaned a bit about how
students &ldquo;chunk&rdquo; mathematical expressions, which is alien to me.
By chunking, I mean how students&rsquo; break down and piece together math
expressions.

From my lessons on converting from zeros to factors of polynomials, students
have apparently picked up that the factor is supposed to look like the following
`\((\Box + \Box)^{\Box}\)` or `\((\Box - \Box)^{\Box}\)`. They know, to some
extent, that the first `\(\Box\)` should be `\(x\)`. But what they are troubled
by is that, in their minds, `\(1 + 2 i\)` cann&rsquo;t &ldquo;fit&rdquo; into
the middle `\(\Box\)`. Confused, they improvise by filling the form
`\(\Box + \Box)^{\Box}` as `\(\boxed{1} + \boxed{2 i}\)^{\boxed{1}}`. To them,
the complex number `\(1 + 2 i\)` cannot fit into one `\(\Box\)`. This complex
number is two chunks, not one, and only exhibits the form `\(\Box + \Box\)`.

## Fixing This Misunderstanding ##

The difficulty in any fix is that we rarely, if ever, address such subtle
topics. So we have few resources and practices to borrow from in order to show
that `\(1 + 2 i\)` can be seen as one chunk and fit into a single `\(\Box\)`.
For a short term fix, I&rsquo;m going to briefly mention this error in class and
briefly mention how expressions like `\(1 + 2 i\)` can be broken down/chunked.
To really address the underlying conceptual error, I think it would be a mistake
to simply add a lesson to a curriculum as the topic is rather disconnected from
a typical math course. Rather, the language of mathematics itself might need to
appear in class by, perhaps, presenting various ways of writing and representing
math or by continually translating between English and math.
