# Handwritten, Digital Lecture Notes: A First Attempt

A report on my experience using OneNote to keep handwritten lecture
notes, which I plan to distribute to students.

## Motivation

The idea of posting lecture notes
online and prior to class has intrigued from the beginning. First, I
tried recording lectures and posting them to
[my YouTube channel][7]. But with the available version of Blackboard, I
couldn’t track specifically which students were watching the
videos. This was bad for me as a teacher and as a math education data
miner. Typing up lecture notes in Microsoft Word or OneNote
would be ~~too time consuming due to all the equations and graphs that
would have to be created~~. So this is my next attempt at providing my
students with lecture notes prior to class.

## Methodology

### Setup

I am writing my notes in Microsoft OneNote 2013 on a Lenovo Yoga Pad
(Intel Core i7 4500U, 8GB RAM) running Windows 10 Pro. This hardware is
a 2-in-1 laptop and tablet, which means that the screen has capacitive
touch input. The stylus that I’m using is an
[Adonit Jot Pro][8], which by the way is
an excellent stylus I took lecture notes for the first week for a
college algebra class and a business calculus class.

### Converting handwriting to text

At first, I tried converting my handwriting, both text and math,
into their proper typeseting. There are two ways of doing
this conversion. First, within paid versions of OneNote, there are
buttons under the “Draw” tab to convert
“Ink to Text” and “Ink to Math”. The other
method uses the handwriting input panel and the math input panel. All
conversions required some degree of manual correction, with the math
conversions requiring the most. Out of all of these methods, the
handwriting input panel was perhaps the best due to it taking a few
words at a time. This meant that my errors could be more easily
detected and were quicker to correct due to the software offering
suggested corrections.

Once I dug through the settings, and told the handwriting input panel to
allow me to write words one letter at a time rather than altogether
with cursive writing, the handwriting became accurate enough to
be usable. The mathematical handwriting was astonishing, but not good
enough to use regularly. I say this because recognizing mathematical
writing is much harder than regular writing.
With subscripts, superscripts, funny Greek letters, large fractions,
etc., Microsoft has done a great job with their math input panel.
It’s just not finished yet. Take for examles some common errors
which I came across (1) the math input thinks my ‘0’s are
‘3’s; (2) I cannot write my ‘1’s with the hat
and stand serifs; (3) and multiline equations are out, and so get used
to equations that ride off the right hand side rather than down the
page.

### Just handwriting

The tedium of converting and correcting lead me to just leave my
handwriting as is. As an aside, the troubles which I list in this
section are troubles that also plagued were present when trying to do
conversions. The first and primary
problem that I encountered was that of palm rejection on my setup.
Because I’m using a capacitive stylus, my laptop is unable to
distinguish between my stylus and my palm. So when I’m lucky, my
palms won’t interfere with my use of the stylus. But too often,
my palms would create unwanted marks within OneNote or select another
application to the foreground, which interrupted my work flow. To avoid
this, I would need to use something like a Wacom stylus or switch to a
Microsoft Surface and it’s pen. In other words, some other setup
where the device and stylus communicate through means other than
capacitance. This inability with my palm on the writing surface forced
me to write in an unfamiliar way, resulting in my handwriting being
worse than usual. Thus my writing was not as clean as I would prefer.

My only other complaint is minor. The only way that I could draw in a
thick dot was to manually select a pen with a larger stroke size. Then
I could dab a point onto OneNote. This is a small complaint until you
realize that drawing points in math is rather common. Then this
required and manual formatting change, which takes a few seconds,
starts to become a real nuisance.

## Results

I apologize for the nonnative web file formats. My future syllabi will
be HTML. But I do not know about any web-friendly handwriting file
formats nor any robust applications which support them.

## Conclusions

I am not going to continue with this setup. It’s too tedious.
My plan for now is maybe LaTeX, until I get my Livescribe pen and paper
back. I’m eying a Surface Pro 4 though. It has the palm
rejection due to the non-capacitive pen, and the extra buttons on the
pen promise to eliminate a lot of the tedium of handwriting in OneNote.

Handwriting text worked rather well. My computer registered my
stylus marks almost immediately. And if anyone is looking for a stylus
for their electronic device, I highly recommend
[Adonit Jot Pro][8] because of its
precision. I was able to make marks exactly where I wanted with little
to no difficulty.

## Addendum

Turns out that typing math into OneNote, and other Office products, is
a lot easier once you learn that the keyboard shortcut to insert an
equation is <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>=</kbd>. Now I just need to figure out
how to quickly and easily put graphs into OneNote.
