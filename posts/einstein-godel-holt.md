## Preamble ##

It's incredibly frustrating to see beauty where others do not. This isolation is
one of the main problems about studying mathematics. Whenever I answer the
question “What do you do?”, I expect my answer to immediately kill this line of
discussion. Not only do people have little idea about what I do, they *hate*
what I do. This is the isolation: what I love, others loathe. Where I see deep,
rich beauty, others cannot avert their eyes fast enough. This is why attempts to
popularize mathematics interest me. They offer me an opportunity to connect with
others, and those I love, over my life’s passion.

# When Einstein Walked with [Gödel][1] #

This book by Jim Holt is the best popularization of mathematics that I have yet
read. Not only is it approachable, but it does so while diving deep into the
mathematics. The fact that the average reader will miss some of the finer points
is alleviated by the fact that they are engaged. (Granted, this might be helped
with an audiobook, as the listeners complete attention isn’t required.) The book
is a collection of essays by the author written in the style of “cocktail party
chat with a few marks on a napkin.”

After an introduction, the author starts with the titular essay. He describes
who Einstein and Gödel are, and how they became friends at Princeton. The
summary of their individual works is quite good. And the author mentions the
tale when Gödel presented Einstein with a birthday present of a spinning
model of the universe that allows for doppelgangers. The next chapter discusses
the nature of time in light of Einstein’s general relativity, how the theory
precludes any synchronous events which results in the lack of “now” in time.
Holt discusses Einstein’s eternalist view of time and how it fits with his
theories.

In the fourth chapter, Holt discusses the [Riemann Zeta hypothesis][2], which I
found stunning. What is impressive is that the author actually explains what the
hypothesis says. This is where Holt impressed me with the depth of his coverage
of mathematics. Some other topics that the book covers are:

- the neuroscience of numbers and how our minds represent quantities through an
  examination of the work of Stanislas Dehaene, author of
  *The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics*.
- [Sir Francis Galton][3] as the father of statistics and eugenics. His eugenic
  dreams ultimately dashed due to the statistical concept of “regression to the
  mean.” And a look at modern day eugenics via genetic engineering.
- [Grothendieck’s][4] work in category theory and how the unending chains of
  abstraction impact mathematicians ability to grasp truth.
- a discussion about why the Russians embraced the concept of infinity but the
  French did not. It provides evidence for this in that Russians who explored
  the infinite were mystics involved with a cult worshiping the name of god.

## What the Book Does Well ##

The book does a great job communicating the feeling of mathematics. Holt gets
across the ethereal nature of mathematical knowledge. The book is filled with
portrayals of both romantic genius and the not so romantic kind. I enjoyed the 
chapter on worshiping infinity and mysticism in mathematics, as I expect it may
surprise some readers. I found myself stopping what I was doing to pay full
attention while to listening to the audiobook. A smile that ran ear to ear grew
upon my face. It was delightful to hear such an intelligent and detailed account
of things like the life of [Mandelbrot][5] and [Turing][6], as well as ideas
like the [four color theorem][7], the [infinitesimal][8], and the
[string theory][9] wars. 

## What the Book Does Poorly (in my opinion) ##

I didn’t care as much for the last chapters of the book as for the rest of
the book. For, at the end of the book, Holt moved away from mathematical topics
to purely philosophical ones. I wasn’t as attentive to these parts as others.
Topics like are computers beneficial to we humans and moral sainthood felt
extraneous to the overall theme of the book.

## Comments ##

Overall, I was impressed with author Jim Holt’s ability to captivate the
listener while occasionally losing them in the details. For me, this book is
going to rank as one of the best popularization of mathematics that I will
likely ever encounter.
