# Capsule Network Performance with Autonomous Navigation #

In this paper, available on [arxiv.org][2] ([2002.03181][1]), the authors Molnar
and Culurciello use capsule networks to do autonomous navigation in simulated
environments, and compare the performance to that of convolutional networks.
Such convolutional neural networks are unable by their internal data
representation struggle to maintain spatial hierarchies between simple and
complex objects. Whereas capsule networks, which encode their data as vectors,
can encode the probability of feature detection as the magnitude of the vector
and the state of the detected feature in the direction of the vector. So a
detected feature that moves around will have its associated vector maintain the
same magnitude throughout the movement but alter their vector&rsquo;s
orientation. Via dynamic routing, a capsule network sends lower-level capsule
outputs to higher-level capsules with similar outputs&mdash;where the dot
product measures similarity of vector outputs.

The task of autonomous navigation is one of reinforcement learning. This papers
approach differs from previous similar ones that used convolutional networks and
had intrinsic rewards to deal with sparse reward scenarios. Without intrinsic
rewards, convolutional networks are unable to explore effectively. But the 
authors show that capsule networks are able to explore without intrinsic
rewards. Compared to Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) and Depth-Augmented
Curiosity Module (D-ACM), the authors networks are much smaller and are faster
to train a single step. Further, they perform better in the densely textured
simulated environments, though perform poorly when in sparsley textured
environments.
