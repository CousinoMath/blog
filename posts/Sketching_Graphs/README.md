# Asking about Extrema and Inflection Points

A few years ago, my exam questions over extrema and/or inflection points read in
a way similar to the following.

> For the function `\(f(x)\,\unicode[STIXGeneral]{x2254}\,x^{5} - 5 x\)`, find
> all extrema and all inflection points, as well as intervals of monotonicity
> and intervals of concavity.

But now, I include a graph of the function with the exam questions.

_TODO_ include graph: []()

Notice how there are no tick marks on the axes. This prevents guessing the
answers when the answers are at integer points. Here are my thoughts, as well
as some of my colleagues thoughts, on this change.

### Advantages of Including the Graph

I include graphs because I feel that students get lost in putting the critical
points on a number line and testing the intervals in between. Admittedly, while
this is not a difficult task, I think that students are deterred by its tedium.
Whereas looking at a graph, be it plotted on a graphing calculator or given with
the question, a student can immediately determine where the function is
increasing or decreasing and concave up or concave down, once they know where
the critical points and potential inflection points. My hope is that this will
improve student understanding by omitting unnecessary tedium and focusing on
more important concepts.

I can now use a graphing utility when going over such examples without
pressuring students to go out an buy a graphing calculator. And I get extra
class time by not having to testing for the sign of derivatives.

### Disadvantages of Including the Graph and Mitigation

There are functions like
`\(f(x),\unicode[STIXGeneral]{x2254}\,x^{5} - x^{3} - 2 x\)` whose graph does
not clearly show concavity. I can avoid such functions on exams without loosing
assessment value. And for homework and in class, graphing the first and second
derivatives will clear up any confusion.

I asked colleagues if they could find any more flaws in this idea. The only
suggestion was that students might have a weaker association between a positive
first derivative and an increasing function, etc. This problem might be averted
by using the extra class time to address exercises like the following.

> Given the graph of `\(f(x)\)`, sketch `\(f'(x)\)` and `\(f''(x)\)` on the
> same graph.
>
> []()

> Given the graph of `\(f'(x)\)`, sketch `\(f(x)\)` on the same graph.

> Given the graph of `\(f''(x)\)`, sketch `\(f'(x)\)` and `\(f(x)\)` on the
> same graph.

I would predict that this mitigation would help students build a related, but
distinct connection between the sign of the first derivative and monotonicity.

## Your Thoughts

Would you predict the same things that I and/or some of my colleagues have?

1. Students get bogged down when testing the sign of derivatives and hence lose
   understanding of the broader principles.

2. The only disadvantage to including graphs with extrema and/or inflection
   point questions is a weaker association between the sign of the first
   derivative and monotonicity as well as sign of the second derivative and
   concavity.

3. This disadvantage can be mitigated by having students sketch graphs of
   derivatives from the graph of a function and vice versa.
