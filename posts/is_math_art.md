# Is Math Art?

This post was inspired by the book _A Mathematician&rsquo;s Lament_ by Paul
Lockhart which argues that math is art and that school kills enjoyment of
the subject. As an aside, I found this book to be an angry diatribe which only
engages in its issues superficially. If you&rsquo;ve never heard about the
idea that math is art and are intrigued, borrow the book from a
library first. But this post isn&rsquo;t a review of the book. This is my
current thinking on the question what is math, or at least theoretical math.

## Math is not art

I no longer think math is art. But I used to. Like many drawn to the subject,
I found it beautiful. So I thought of math as an art form, because I naively
assumed that beauty was in the domain of art. My current understanding is that
art is not just beauty. It is more about expressing emotions and experiences
in a way that allows others to connect to that expression.

With this belief, mathematics is clear not a form of art. Which piece of math
expresses sadness in your opinion? I venture to guess that no theorem, proof,
definition, or example came to mind. If anything did come to mind, it was a
memory of bitterly struggling with math rather than math itself. Let&rsquo;s
approach the same idea from a different perspective by considering
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems. What emotions or experiences do you
think G&ouml;del was trying to express with these theorems and proofs?
Aside from the likes of awe and amazement, what emotions do they evoke in you?
Again, I have nothing. At the time of writing, these inquiries lead me to
believe that math is not art. Yet, I still maintain that math is beautiful.

## What is math?

I&rsquo;m toying with the idea that mathematics is a form of play or social
game. A bit of math can be beautiful similar to how a move in chess can be
beautiful. But unlike chess, math is a much more dynamic game. Actually, I
would argue that math is a collection of games. Research in theoretical math
can be developing new moves in an existing game, developing new games, or
finding commonality between seemingly disparate games.

I won&rsquo;t say much more than this because my arguments are too rough and
uninformed. I plan on reading some of the sociological works on play like
Johan Huizanga&rsquo;s _Homo Ludens_ and Roger Caillois&rsquo;
_Man, Play and Games_.
